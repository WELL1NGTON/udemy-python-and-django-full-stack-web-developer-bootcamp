# TODO: Finish it, the rules about "it is war" are too confusing for me to do at my own
# but for now the base logic is done, later i'll research this bad "game" to understand
# better how to implement that part of the game..

### WELCOME TO YOUR OOP PROJECT #####
#####################################

# For this project you will be using OOP to create a card game. This card game will
# be the card game "War" for two players, you an the computer. If you don't know
# how to play "War" here are the basic rules:
#
# The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time,
# face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places his stack of cards face down,
# in front of him.
#
# The Play:
#
# Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card
# takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.
#
# If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up three cards face
# down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles
# (six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places
# another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the
# higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.
#
# There are some more variations on this but we will keep it simple for now.
# Ignore "double" wars
